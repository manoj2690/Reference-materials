Hi @sigudd @chudyed ,
I have check the above post by @angelozerr after I have made my hand dirty with doing something which i dont know exactly. In my preference, above checkboxes are not selected.

What I have done?

Copy the latest nodejs exe
Navigate to the following path
C:\Users\XXXXXX.p2\pool\plugins\tern.eclipse.ide.server.nodejs.embed.win32.win32.x86_64_1.2.0.201606160856\node-v4.2.4-win32-x86_64
Rename the original exe as a backup
Paste the latest nodejs exe
Now the name is same but exe is latest
I am by far not a developer so no idea but as a wild guess it is a problem with the tern plugin embed nodejs.

@chudyed
after I set a new location of node.js like you said and run conf.js a get an error:
Sunny@ I am expecting that you are able to run protractor through cmd prompt.
Try to run the webdriver-manager update.
If it does not solve the problem, then check the browser version of chrome and see if it the latest as I have see some post related to latest browser issue.
Then, no idea....I will try to reproduce this first and will keep doing my hit and trial.

Do let me know if it help.
